# LinShutdown
The Linux version of my original WinShutdown application:

    https://github.com/jcemerson/WinShutdown

This was strictly designed to meet the requirements my wife defined
for her needs, namely:

    1. Simple, easy-to-use interface
    2. Large buttons for convenient selection
    3. Preset time-settings for convenient, quick setting of timer
    4. Large, easy-to-see UI and timer

We literally use this tool every night to shutdown our bedroom PC,
which is strictly used to watch TV in bed, after we fall asleep.

As such, this app's current functionality is limited in scope and
is likely to not be all things everybody ever wanted in such a
tool, or anything else it was never meant to be.

That said, I do intend to add enhancements with time to offer
increased flexibility and options for different use-cases. Feel
free to suggest features and/or functionality you wish to see,
or fork the repository and submit your own pull requests..

Also, please feel free to help me grow and perfect this craft by
offering constructive criticism and guidance toward improving the
existing codebase.
