# LinShutdown
The Linux version of my original WinShutdown tool.

This was designed with my wife's particular specifications to suit her use-case scenario. This was not meant to be everything everybody wanted that it's currently not, though I do intend to update it and/or fork it into a separate product with a greater functionality and flexibility.
